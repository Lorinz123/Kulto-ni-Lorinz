            <h3><b>WELCOME TO SIGMA ASSOCIATION! </b></h3>
            <p1>Welcome to the SIGMA Association Office, Region VII, where only the strongest, smartest, and most aura-infused individuals thrive. This isn't just a website; it's a test of your worth. If you think you can waltz in here without at least 1,000 Aura Points, I hate to break it to you, but you're still in the tutorial phase of life.  

                So, what is this sacred institution? It's not just a group; it's a lifestyle. The SIGMA Association isn't for NPCs, casuals, or anyone who still needs permission to stay up past 10 PM. We are the elite, the grindset warriors, the ones who understand that success doesn't come from respawning—it comes from dominating every quest thrown our way.  
                Can you even join? Not just anyone can. There are rules. There are requirements. And most importantly, there's the Aura Points system. To enter, you must have 1,000 Aura Points, which can only be earned through dedication, strategy, and perhaps a little bit of main character energy. If you've spent your days scrolling endlessly through side quests, also known as social media, instead of leveling up, you might want to reconsider your priorities.  
                If you think this is some basic club where you just sign up and get a badge, that's rookie mentality. You don't just apply to SIGMA. You prove you belong. You grind, you conquer, and you ascend.  
                What happens if you don't qualify? Simple. You touch grass, meditate on your failures, and return when you're built different. We'll still be here, waiting for you to rise from mediocrity like a true SIGMA warrior.  
                For those who are already certified chads of determination, welcome. The grind never stops, and neither do we.</p1>

            <h4><b>HOW TO JOIN SIGMA ASSOCIATION?</b></h4>
            <p2> So, you think you have what it takes? Becoming a SIGMA member isn't for the weak. Here's how to prove you're built different:  
               <ul>
                <li>Gather 1,000 Aura Points  Earn them through sheer grind, dominance, and maybe a few side quests. </li>
                <li>Fill out the Sacred Form – Only the worthy shall complete it without rage-quitting.</li>
                <li>Pass the Vibe Check – If you're not radiating peak sigma energy, we'll know.</li>
                <li>Survive the Initiation – We can't tell you what it is, but if you know, you know.</li>
               </ul>
               <p2>Do you have what it takes? Or will you remain an NPC? The choice is yours.</p2>

        <h5><b>Meet Our Founder: The One and Only Gigachad</b></h5>
         <img src="https://preview.redd.it/the-gigachad-v0-0wlf07gr2wsc1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=489e6fa32a21822c98ef07efaffbac9919c726e7">
        <br>
         <p3>Long ago, before the world knew true greatness, a legend was born. A being so powerful, so enlightened, and so undeniably sigma that mere mortals could only aspire to walk in his shadow. That being is none other than Gigachad, the founding father of the SIGMA Association.  
            With a jawline sharper than our deadlines and an aura so strong it warps reality, Gigachad didn't just start this organization. He manifested it into existence through sheer willpower and peak efficiency. While others hesitated, he grinded. While the weak doubted, he dominated. And when the world asked, why, he simply replied, because I can.   
            His teachings live on in the SIGMA way, through the pursuit of excellence, the rejection of mediocrity, and the relentless grindset mentality. If you seek true power, look no further than the path he paved. But beware, only those with 1,000 Aura Points or more may fully comprehend his wisdom. 
            Gigachad doesn't just lead. He is the blueprint.</p3>
